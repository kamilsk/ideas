## Problematic

Current picture:

- Some collections reside in [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/8eOiv4I4).
- Somewhat collections are stored in [Toby](https://www.gettoby.com/).
- Something is open in Tab Groups in browsers.
- Some are saved in Saved Messages [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) or [Slack](http://slack.com/).
- A substantial part of competitors is collected in the [Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/inlqolf5id34) database.

### Problem #1

> **TL;DR:** no single source of truth.

Scattered in different places are links for which a single context is important to make the necessary decisions quickly, for example, resurveying a project or studying competitors.

There is often a situation where you want to find all links relevant to a particular context, e.g., "All competitors in the [Task Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management) segment for the [Tact](https://tact.run/) project."

**Implications:** Something needs to be noticed, leading to incorrect conclusions and decisions based on them.

**Possible solutions:** Use always only one of the available tools. For this, [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/8eOiv4I4) or [Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/inlqolf5id34) is the most flexible of the above. They have the significant disadvantage of poor performance, which leads to frustration and subsequently to procrastination and loss of enthusiasm.

### Problem #2

> **TL;DR:** repetitiveness and loss of history.

While researching projects, references to them may pop up repeatedly after a significant period. At the same time, there is no convenient way to quickly get the entire history of these references hitting the radar on previous occasions. This leads to some of the work being done again and some of the valuable findings in the past being missed.

For example, I was researching projects related to [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for [Go](https://go.dev/) some time ago and came across an exciting project, [Charm](https://charm.sh/). A few years later, I was already tackling the more applied task of creating a [template for CLI tools](https://github.com/octomation/go-tool) and had to repeat the research and search for ready-made solutions, even though I could have reused or at least reworked the previous experience.

**Consequences:** extra work, e.g., unnecessary cycling where an off-the-shelf solution could have been done, and the additional cognitive burden of remembering whether or not I crossed paths with this project last time and how it ended up then.

**Possible solutions:** store the whole history of interaction with links in one database, e.g., [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/8eOiv4I4) or [Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/inlqolf5id34). On the plus side, they are already available on various platforms (desktop, mobile, web), and [Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/inlqolf5id34) has, among others, an extension for browsers - [Web Clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper). The disadvantages are performance and broad specialization.

### Problem #3

> **TL;DR:** no relationships and no context.

The same link can pop up in different contexts. For example, the cool project [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/) may be found in [Awesome Go](https://awesome-go.com/) while searching for database schema migration tools, or you may come across it while studying the documentation of another excellent project [ent](https://entgo.io/).

For example, the [Superlist](https://www.superlist.com/) project can be found while exploring the market for [Task Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management) solutions, or one may come across it while watching [a good review](https://youtu.be/eDmhvxioYRk) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). Then, one can learn about a company on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/), a product on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/), etc.

All this enriches the context of the target link and allows you to form a more interesting picture. And the more data there is, the better the conclusions and decisions can be based on it.

**Consequences:** Something needs to be noticed and leads to incorrect conclusions and decisions based on them.

**Possible solutions:** store all relationships in one database, such as [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/8eOiv4I4) or [Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/inlqolf5id34).
